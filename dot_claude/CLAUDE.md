# Home Directory — Not a Project

This is Flo's home directory (`~`), not a code repository.

## Context

- Sessions here are **one-off tasks**: quick questions, admin work, file management, scripting, research, etc.
- There is no project structure, build system, or test suite to worry about.
- Do not create project scaffolding, README files, or documentation unless explicitly asked.

## How to Work Here

- **Be direct and concise.** Skip project-level ceremony (planning mode, task lists, architecture discussion) unless the task genuinely warrants it.
- **Prefer quick answers.** If the user asks a question, answer it. Don't over-structure the response.
- **Temporary files** go in `/tmp` or a clearly named subdirectory — don't litter `~`.
- **When writing scripts**, place them where the user specifies. If unspecified, ask or use a sensible location (not `~` root).
- Code repos live in subdirectories — if the user references a project, `cd` there and check for its own CLAUDE.md.
